    "Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. Any type of data can be subjected to data analytics techniques to get insight that can be used to improve things. All data analysis stems from a question(s) that are then analyzed through various data analytic techniques. Any type of data can be subjected to data analytics techniques to get insight that can be used to improve things. Data analytic techniques can reveal trends and metrics that would otherwise be lost in the mass of information. This information can then be used to optimize processes to increase the overall efficiency of a business or system."

    "Data science analysis tasks can be done in a variety of different programming languages and programs. Each one has pros and cons which must be evaluated against the tasks being performed, knowledge and skill of the analyst, type of data being analyzed, etc. Historically, the two most popular languages are **R** and **Python**. Over time we have seen a shift in popularity from R to Python, possibly as a consequence of data science moving out of the realm of pure statistics and incorporating more algorithmic, programming-heavy tasks such as machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will introduce the \"Swiss army knife\" of data analysis in Python -- **Pandas**. We start by discussing advantages of using Python and Pandas in data science, followed by basic dataframe operations, and finish with some analysis using grouping and aggragating functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this unit, the student should be able to load tabular data files and perform rudimentary analysis. The student should also have a solid foundation from which to use online resources to find more advanced techniques. "

    "Python is a free, open source, general-purpose programming language that has been in existence since 1991. It is already known and in use by millions of programmers and relatively easy to learn for those new to the language. Since it is a general-purpose language, it can be used for more than just analysis.\n",

    "R is a free, open source statistical analysis package made popular by university researchers due to the low cost of ownership. Being a specialized language, it can be difficult to learn, particularly for those who already know programming. While R is, indeed, superior at the statistics aspect, it falls short of Python in both data manipulation (\"data wrangling\") and machine learning, and it is not really possible to write an \"R program\" that stands alone as can be done with Python. This means in many business contexts when analytical code is deployed for general usage, it must be translated from R to another language.  \n",
